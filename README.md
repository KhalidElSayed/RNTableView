RNTableView
===========

This project is simply a starting point for those looking to tear open UITableView and do some highly customized things. I created this for my own implementation of UITableView with a lot of non-standard animations and wanted to strip away all of the default behaviors (background views, selection, labels, etc).

I followed Mike Ash's great [Let's Build UITableView](http://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2013-02-22-lets-build-uitableview.html) post to get started. A lot of the code used here can be found and further explained in the post. I highly recommend going through the post to understand what is happening.
